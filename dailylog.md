### 2025-10-16
- Implemented `pow3r.v3.status.json` schema with reliability and evidence.
- Added `status_v3.py` for conversion from power.status â†’ v3, normalization, Mermaid/Graphviz.
- Added `github_scanner_v3.py`, `run_v3_pipeline.py` to orchestrate scanning and conversion.
- Added `diagram_generator.py` for direct diagram generation from v3.
- Created `abacus/workflow.json` to run the pipeline in Abacus.AI.
- Wrote `README-v3-workflow.md` usage and notes.

Insights:
- Reliability driven by commit activity, centrality, connectivity, and authors improves trustworthiness.
- Evidence array makes diagram claims auditable.

Issues:
- Graphviz not guaranteed in all environments; SVG generation is best-effort.

In-progress:
- None.

New issues:
- Consider optional GitHub enrichment for commit file details to improve per-file activity scoring.
