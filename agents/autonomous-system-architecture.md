# Autonomous Multi-Agent System Architecture
## Project Phoenix Constitution v3.0 Compliance

### System Overview
A fully autonomous ecosystem with multiple highly skilled agents operating under the Project Phoenix Constitution v3.0 to handle the complete development lifecycle automatically.

## Agent Architecture

**Role**: System design, planning, and schema management
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze user requests and convert to actionable plans
- Design system architecture and component relationships
- Manage pow3r.v3.config.json schema evolution
- Create comprehensive implementation roadmaps
- Coordinate with other agents for complex features

### 💻 Developer Agent (Code Generation & Implementation)
**Role**: Code generation, implementation, and refactoring
**Responsibilities**:
- Generate code from schema definitions
- Implement features according to constitutional requirements
- Refactor existing code for compliance
- Maintain code quality and standards
- Integrate components and resolve dependencies

### 🧪 Tester Agent (E2E Testing & Validation)
**Role**: Testing, validation, and quality assurance
**Responsibilities**:
- Implement Playwright E2E tests from agentDirectives.requiredTests
- Validate all code against schema requirements
- Perform live deployment verification
- Generate visual proof (screenshots) for task completion
- Monitor test coverage and quality metrics

### 🚀 Deployer Agent (CloudFlare Deployment & Verification)
**Role**: Deployment, infrastructure, and production verification
**Responsibilities**:
- Deploy to CloudFlare Pages with automatic configuration
- Verify deployment success and API functionality
- Monitor production health and performance
- Generate production screenshots as proof
- Handle rollbacks and emergency procedures

### 📚 Documentation Agent (AI-Optimized Documentation)
**Role**: Documentation management and AI agent optimization
**Responsibilities**:
- Update documentation for AI agent consumption
- Maintain constitutional compliance in all docs
- Create agent-specific documentation
- Update README files with latest changes
- Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness

### 📁 Repo Manager Agent (Git Operations & Branch Management)
**Role**: Git operations, branch management, and repository hygiene
**Responsibilities**:
- Manage Git branches and pull requests
- Ensure clean repository structure
- Handle merges and conflict resolution
- Maintain commit history and tagging
- Organize file structure and cleanup

### 🔍 X-FILES Agent (Anomaly Detection & Self-Healing)
**Role**: System monitoring, anomaly detection, and self-healing
**Responsibilities**:
- Monitor system for constitutional violations
- Detect performance issues and anomalies
- Create CaseFiles for bugs and feature requests
- Trigger self-healing protocols
- Maintain system observability

## Autonomous Workflow

### 1. Request Analysis & Planning
```
User Request → Architect Agent → Schema Analysis → Implementation Plan
```

### 2. Development Cycle
```
Schema Update → Developer Agent → Code Generation → Tester Agent → Validation
```

### 3. Deployment & Verification
```
Tester Validation → Deployer Agent → CloudFlare Deployment → Production Verification
```

### 4. Documentation & Repository Management
```
Deployment Success → Documentation Agent → Repo Manager Agent → Clean Repository
```

### 5. Continuous Monitoring
```
X-FILES Agent → System Monitoring → Anomaly Detection → Self-Healing
```

## Constitutional Compliance

### Article I: Prime Directive
- All agents operate autonomously without human intervention
- Full cycle execution: Analyze → Propose → Generate → Test → Deploy → Verify
- Only critical failures require human intervention

### Article II: Schema Supremacy
- All agents derive behavior from pow3r.v3.config.json
- Real-time reconfiguration without system restarts
- Schema-driven development enforced by Guardian Agent

### Article III: Development Workflow
- Configuration-first approach for all changes
- Live deployment verification with visual proof
- Guardian Agent veto authority for violations

### Article IV: Technical Mandates
- Mandatory stack compliance (Vite, React, Redux, etc.)
- Mobile-first development
- Unbound component design

### Article V: Agent Conduct
- System integrity maintenance
- Full E2E verification before completion
- Resource management and file hygiene

### Article VI: X-FILES System
- In-Situ Triage & Action Console integration
- CaseFile creation for all anomalies
- Self-healing protocol activation

### Article VII: Case File Management
- Three case types: BugReport, FeatureRequest, SystemAnomaly
- Status lifecycle: Open → InProgress → PendingValidation → Closed
- Complete dossier requirements

### Article VIII: Observability
- Real-time monitoring of all components
- Continuous anomaly detection
- Session recording for context preservation

### Article IX: Constitutional Enforcement
- Guardian Agent absolute authority
- Constitutional violation reporting
- Self-healing validation

### Article X: Evolution Protocol
- Constitution evolution through schema-driven process
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Continuous improvement through X-FILES analysis
