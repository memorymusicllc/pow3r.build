- Purpose: Comprehensive request tracking and analysis

## Request Tracking Rules
1. All requests are assumed NOT done, regardless of completion claims
2. Each repetition of a subject increases unresolved likelihood by 10%
3. User critiques and development issues = requests to solve
4. All "Next Steps" replies are recorded as To-dos
5. All unchecked To-dos are tracked
